# sprengBoard Chelix

Inspired by the [Helix keyboard by Makoto Kurauchi](https://github.com/MakotoKurauchi/helix), the Chelix is a compact, split ortholinear 50- or 64-key mechanical keyboard desgined exclusively for low-profile Kailh Choc V1 key switches. The keys of the Chelix are spaced in 18x17mm increments to take advantage of smaller Choc keycaps, which results in an even more compact, low-profile keyboard than the original [Helix](https://github.com/MakotoKurauchi/helix).

Like the [Helix](https://github.com/MakotoKurauchi/helix), the Chelix features a 6x5+2 layout (6 keys per row with 5 rows plus 2 thumb keys) with a removable bottom row to form a 6x5+1 layout for those seeking the ultimate compactness.
