# sprengBoard Chelix

Inspired by the [Helix keyboard by Makoto Kurauchi](https://github.com/MakotoKurauchi/helix), the Chelix is a compact, split ortholinear 50- or 64-key mechanical keyboard desgined exclusively for low-profile Kailh Choc V1 key switches. The keys of the Chelix are spaced in 18x17mm increments to take advantage of smaller Choc keycaps, which results in an even more compact, low-profile keyboard than the original [Helix](https://github.com/MakotoKurauchi/helix) (i.e., less finger travel).

Like the [Helix](https://github.com/MakotoKurauchi/helix), the Chelix features a 6x5+2 layout (6 keys per row with 5 rows plus 2 thumb keys; total of 64 keys) with a removable bottom row to form a 6x4+1 layout (50 keys) for those seeking the ultimate compactness. The Chelix also features the following:

* Reversible PCBs with hotswap sockets
* [Adafruit's KB2040 Kee Boar Driver](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5302) (based on the [Raspberry Pi RP2040](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040/))
* [QMK](https://github.com/qmk) firmware
* [VIA](https://www.caniusevia.com/) compatible (json upload required)
