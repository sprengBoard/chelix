# sprengBoard Chelix

Inspired by the [Helix keyboard by Makoto Kurauchi](https://github.com/MakotoKurauchi/helix), the Chelix is a compact, split ortholinear 50- or 64-key keybaord desgined exclusively for low-profile Kailh Choc V1 mechanical switches. The keys of the Chelix are spaced in 18x17mm increments to take advantage of smaller Choc keycaps, which results in a very compact, low-profile ergonomic keyboard.
